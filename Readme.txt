For this task i have used 3 classses.
1.baseTest- In which i have written a code for pasring the JSON data.
2.testLogic-In which i have written a logic for the task  I have to perform.
3.testClass- In which I have executed the test cases and validated the results.

I have tried in another repo by commiting at regular interval but gone through some technical glitch so just commited in another repo at once.


Please give the feedback early if possible as I am serving Notice Period.
