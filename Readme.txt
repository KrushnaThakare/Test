For this task I have used 3 classses.
1.baseTest- In which i have written a code for pasring the JSON data.
2.testLogic-In which i have written a logic for the task  I have to perform.
3.testClass- In which I have executed the test cases and validated the results.

I have tried in another repo by commiting at regular interval but gone through some technical glitch so just commited in another repo at once.
I haven't attcahed .gitignore as master is rejecting due to network problem at that moment will clarify later

!! Thank You !!
